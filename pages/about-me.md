  bio: |
    I'm currently a junior studying Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park. I expect to graduate in 2027

    I wish to specialize in AI/ML in my junior and senior years. I am yet to pick specific courses tailored towards a specific field in the computer science/engineering domain. This summer I will be working my professor and gratuate mentor to use AI to monitor air pollution.

    Aside from academics, I enjoy crocheting and sewing. I also enjoy travelling.
