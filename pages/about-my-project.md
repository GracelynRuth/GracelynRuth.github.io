subtitle: Air Pollution Detection and AI Models
project_title: "Monitoring Urban Air Pollution from Satellite Data using Machine Learning"

problem: |
  In today's world, the increasing rate of air pollution directly correlates to health issues in many individuals. Air pollutants in the air, such as Aerosol, PM2.5 etc, linger in our atmosphere in great amounts leading to various respiratory issues amongst many people. 
  In this project, we aim to explore the relationship between air pollutants and respiratory/health issues in many individuals. This project is focused on using satelite data to find correlations between various properties of air pollutants and human health, by training AI models to detect it.

approach: |
  The project follows a four-phase pipeline:

  - Create a comprehensive database of Aerosol Optical Depths and PM2.5
  - Preprocess datasets from satellite observations
  - Use satellite derived AOD to derive PM2.5
  - Produce geographical coverage of near-surface PM2.5 using AI/ML algorithms
  - Enchance NASA's satellite observation of near-surface PM2.5 concentrations

  The primary open source tool that will be used is Python (Libraries through Google Collab)

outcome: |
  In this program we will learn of the machine learning techniques for satellite data retrieval related to air quality in the Baltimore-Washington area. We will learn of basic machine learning tools, such as random forest, and also methods of data collection, format and matching.
