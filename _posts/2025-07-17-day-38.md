what_i_learned: |
  For the first half of our day, we engaged in a research paper writing workshop with Dr. Pandey. During this workshop, we were given a general overview of how to dress, present and write a research paper. I learned today that when presenting darker colors and minimal hand movements are the best when it comes to captivating the audience. 

  Following our session with Dr. Pandey, I was able to continue working on the data we had for the padonia station. I trained it on an LSTM model, and obtained an R2 of close to 0.75. From the models I trained I concluded that gradient boosting performed the best.

  For some reason when my peer trained their gradient boosting model on the same data, he got an R2 of close to 0.85.

reflection: |
  From today's workshop I learned a lot about how I must dress and act during a presentation. I also was able to get a general idea of what our research paper is supposed to look like. After training our data on various other models, I was able to gain confidence on our code and results.
