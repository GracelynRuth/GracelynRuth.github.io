  A huge portion of our day today was dedicated to working on our slides and completing them. I worked on the Data and Pre-liminary Findings slide. I was able to decribe key findings from our data analysis phase. One finding that stuck out to me was that AOD had the least contribution towards the amount of PM2.5 measured. However, as I learned from a short session with Dr. Li, that defeats the purpose of our research. In order for our research to be successful we need accurate data from Satellites to show the correlation between AOD and PM2.5. With this in mind, we were instructed to proof-read our code again, to ensure we had not deleted some data from our dataset.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  Today I got a gist of what research would be like. I came to an understanding that if the data we have is not continous and complete our research outcomes may be contrary to our thesis. From the session I had with Dr. Li, I was able to understand that research primarily consists of a lot of data analysis. This also inspired me to think of ways to improve our data search to ensure our predictions are valid. I was also able to see a potential flaw in AI. According to the models we used (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting), PM2.5 could be predicted with a relatively high accuracy despite the fact that AOD - our most important contributor to our predictions, did not have a significant impact on PM2.5. We learned that this is were human eyes come in to spot the issues with our predictions.
