what_i_learned: |
  A significant portion of our day was dedicated to finalizing our presentation slides. I focused on the Data and Preliminary Findings slide, where I summarized key insights from our data analysis. One finding that stood out was that Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) appeared to have the least contribution to the measured levels of PM2.5. However, during a brief discussion with Dr. Li, I learned that this result contradicts the core objective of our research. For our study to be meaningful, the satellite-derived AOD data must reliably correlate with PM2.5 concentrations. Given this, we were advised to thoroughly review our code to ensure that no critical data were inadvertently excluded during preprocessing or analysis.

reflection: |
  Today I got a gist of what research would be like. I came to an understanding that if the data we have is not continous and complete our research outcomes may be contrary to our thesis. From the session I had with Dr. Li, I was able to understand that research primarily consists of a lot of data analysis. This also inspired me to think of ways to improve our data search to ensure our predictions are valid. I was also able to see a potential flaw in AI. According to the models we used (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting), PM2.5 could be predicted with a relatively high accuracy despite the fact that AOD - our most important contributor to our predictions, did not have a significant impact on PM2.5. We learned that this is were human eyes come in to spot the issues with our predictions.
