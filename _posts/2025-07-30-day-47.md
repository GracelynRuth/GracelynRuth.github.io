what_i_learned: |
  We dedicated this day to be just for practicing how to present our slides. We began our day by ensuring the format of the slides and report was consistent. I was also able to condense the images for the padonia station into one image so it looked neater on the report and slides. Immediately after that we began rehearsing our lines with our slides. The first run was a little rough, because we had to figure out who would be changing slides and how our speaker - switches would go. I was thrilled to be the one to pop a helium balloon as a live demonstration of our project. We had the opportunity to test it out in the rehearsal with our mentors and also obtained minor changes from them. We then implemented the suggested changes which were changing the wording on the slides, regenerating our graphs with better heading sizes and some minor corrections to the slide formatting.

reflection: |
  Today is the last day of actual work for the program. We've come a long way and I'm glad we had the opportunities we were given throughout this program to demonstrate our skills and build a team together. Through this presentation I was able to understand how much more we could expand on in our research.
