what_i_learned: |
  Our day began with a trip to a Meterological station nearby. During our visit, we had a tour of the equipment and measurements they obtain from the equipment they had. We also learned how to fly a drone to collect atmospheric data. We also launched an air balloon to measure key meterological data.
