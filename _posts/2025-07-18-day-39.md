what_i_learned: |
  Our day began with a trip to a Meterological station nearby. During our visit, we had a tour of the equipment and measurements they obtain from the equipment they had. We also learned how to fly a drone to collect atmospheric data. We also launched an air balloon to measure key meterological data.

reflection: |
  Today was a great day. My peers were kind enough to let me be the first volunteer in many activities. I really enjoyed brainstorming ideas for our elevator pitch and understanding the different views my peers had on how to carry out our pitch. Flying the drone was also a new experience for me, I enjoyed learning the mechanics of drones and also I was surprised by the pictures and videos it could take.
