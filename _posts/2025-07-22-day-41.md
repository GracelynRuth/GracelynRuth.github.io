what_i_learned: |
  My day today involved a lot of staring at our data and results and trying to improve our visualization of feature importances and output graphs. The first thing I had to do was figure out how to graph the feature importance for an lstm. I had to find code for generating these graphs on the internet to ensure my results were correct. After I was able to generate a somewhat reasonable graph, I moved on to work on our research paper. Being responsible for the introduction and conclusion, I drafted an introduction using the sample we were given by our mentor. I was able to concisely write about what our project was about and its importance. 

  Next, we drafted an outline for our elevator pitch and began discussing what shots we would need for the video and what lines we would have to say.

  When obtaining code from the internet, it was so hard to make it work. Most of the time it gave me errors that were also hard to understand given the limited python deep learning knowledge I have.

reflection: |
  Throughout this day, I was able to reflect on all that we had accomplished as a group. When writing the introduction, I was constantly reminded of the first literature review we read and the first piece of code we wrote. It is amazing how we have come this far, modifing and perfecting our code to yield the best results. Through all of our trial and errors I am glad we have come to a constant and standard state.
