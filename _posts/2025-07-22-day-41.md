what_i_learned: |
  My day today involved a lot of staring at our data and results and trying to improve our visualization of feature importances and output graphs. The first thing I had to do was figure out how to graph the feature importance for an lstm.
  
blockers: |
  No blocker's today!

reflection: |
  I learned a lot from the latter half of our day. Through much trial and error, I came to a conclusion that Gradient boost worked the best with our data, and that Neural Networks, in general, tend to perform better with consistent data.
