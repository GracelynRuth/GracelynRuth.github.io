what_i_learned: |
  We learned a lot of information today. We began the day by listening to a detailed presentation about Computer Vision from a guest speaker. During the presentation, we also had the opportunity to try training computer models ourseleves using Teachable Machine and Google Collab. Following that, we had a great time trying to escape virtual escape room with our project team. Through this activity we learnt the importance of teamwork and communication when working in teams. We initially had a hard time trying to find clues from our peers' screens. However, with a little bit more detailed descriptions of each of our screens, we were able to crack all the codes in our rooms. Finally to wrap up our day, we learned how to read and write from files in python, we also shared codes for practice problems involving file I/O.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  My favorite part of today's session was the escape room activity. Despite it not being academic, it showed me how important team work and communication is. I think it also was a great example of how understanding the perspectives and thought of your peers can speed up the collaboration and coordination process. I look forward to more activities like this, that encourage collaboration and team work!
