  Today was the day we met the High School Teacher that will be working with us for this summer. We began our day with our peers from other groups and we had a short ice breaker. In this activity we had to come up with a 30 second summary of our project without including any key words from the title of our project. Following that we had a short lost at sea game, where we had a list of items that we could have on a raft when lost at sea that we had to place on a list in order from the most important to the least important. Our team was a little bit close to the coastguard list - the correct list. The next activity that we had lined up for us was the meet and greet with our High School teachers. Before we began this session, we re-presented our 30 second summary of our projects so the teachers could guess which project they were on. 

  Before we dispersed for lunch, we had a short meeting with our High School teacher, Mrs. Ross Jones. She had us ask ChatGPT to build a superhero personna by prompting it with our three of our strengths and weaknesses. I was the Insightor, the bot had prepared a little background story for me to display my strengths and weaknesses, here's a snipet of what it had given me: "Taking up the mantle of The Insightor, she now travels between disputes, classrooms, and interdimensional misunderstandings. She's not the strongest or flashiest hero — but when understanding is the key to survival, Insightor is irreplaceable." This was a fun activity, where I was able to hear about the strengths and weaknesses of my friends and also our newest member. 

  We also played some robot games, a maze and soccer game with some of Dr. Mack's students. It was a fun game where we had to control the movement of robots using controls on a tablet that we used to navigate the maze.

  At the end of our day we also had a short session on python and implementing automized search algorithms to determine the best combination of parameters for ML models that yield the highest R2 values.

  During the project summary presentations, I found it hard to remember all the key things we had discussed as a group, when actually presenting. I would always say things that we had not practiced. However, I am grateful for my team who cheered me up and accepted every summary I switched through.

   The most fun part about today was actually getting to know our High School Teacher. She is a very kind and funny teacher that I would love to work with for the summer. During our lost at sea activity, I noticed that all groups had different interpretations of how the objects could be utlized for survival, thus the all had different perspectives. I personally remember how within our team we had come up with various survival uses of a shaving mirror. We had concluded that it could be used as a knife to cut fish - when broken in pieces, as a source of fire, as a plate and as a means of defense against sharks if we ran out of shark repellent.
