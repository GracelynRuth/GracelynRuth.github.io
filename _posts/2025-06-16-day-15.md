what_i_learned: |
  We began our day with a little more literature review. Today we focused on finding literatures that talk about the implementation of ML in the field of climate science. We were able to obtain papers that descirbed the history and use of the Random Forest Model. Following that, we took a short trip to a nearby LiDAR station. Finally, to wrap up our day, we had a detailed session on training machine learning models using the sklearn library in python. We were able to train it on sample atmospheric data and obtain a relatively good regression coefficient.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
   We were also able to condense our literature reviews into one single document. I believe this gave me an idea of how many resources we had to pick from when writing out our paper. With the python programming session, I beleive we are now on track to use the skills we learnt on real life data.
