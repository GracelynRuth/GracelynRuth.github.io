  We began our day today by writing up the slides for our weekly presentation, and I think this was a great time to reflect on what we had accomplished and how far along we were on the project. Following this session, we discussed together as a group all the literatures that we had reviewed the yesterday about the implementation of AI in predicting PM2.5 concentrations. Additionally, through the reviews I was able to find out that Random Forest is one of the better algorithms that has been used commonly in the past by many researchers. This also served as an base for what we aim to do and helped up map out all the things we need to do to successfully train our model. At the end of the day, we recorded our video together and reviewed some machine learning python code.

reflection: |
   Through our literature review I was able to get a general idea of the different ML algorithms researchers have used in the past. Many of the literatures we discussed as a team, were very detailed and concluded on one specific ML model that they thought was the best based on the regression coefficient. We were also able to relate the format of the papers that we read to what we are expected to submit at the end of our program. I observed that mutliple graphs and extensive descriptions are required to ensure the reader has a clear idea of your topic, problem, solution/outcomes and challenges.
