what_i_learned: |
  My day began with me trying to build me knowledge on LSTMs and ANNs. I was able to watch a couple more videos to learn a bit more about the math behind LSTMs. I was able to discover that LSTM nodes (a single neuron) have weights for each of its inputs, a bias and an output. So multiple such neurons form layers that form the neural network. The point at which this differs from LSTMs is that in LSTMs each node in the network has a layer of hidden values (short term memory) and long term memory values. 
  Following this session, we had a session with our mentors and high school teachers. During this segment of our day, we discussed short reflections of how our presentations went. We also were able to come up with new stratergies to improve our presentation for the final symposium.
