what_i_learned: |
  Today I spent the entire day learning about Long Short Term Memory models and Artificial Neural Networks. I watched a couple YouTube videos to get a general idea of LSTMs. I understood that they are models that forget irrelevant information and remeber specific details about previous inputs to compute the output. They are also based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), when at each step of computation and processing the output is fed in as input to the model.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  Moving forward from the previous models that we used for our data prediction, I think Neural Networks are a great technique to implement into our code. With the limited knowledge of LSTMs that I have, I am unsure of how to implement it using python. That will be my goal for tomorrow!
