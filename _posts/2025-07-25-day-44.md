what_i_learned: |
  My day began with a workshop about robotics and the implementation of AI/ML in the field of biology and medicine. Dr Chris Crawford from the University of Alabama, walked us through a detailed experiement with brain controlled drones and muscle movement controlled robots. During this session I learned that the various electric signals emitted by the brain as its processing can be interpretted into a frequency. The specific band of a brain signal can then be intepreted into a control for a drone, such as move forward, backward etc. Similar to brain signals, Electromyography (EMG - muscle signals) can be translated into movement instructions for a small robot. These sessions were very engaging and hands-on, I was able to get a general idea of what I would like to work on in the future.

  Following this segment, we split up our work for the end of summer symposium. I will be working on the challenges faced, future works and acknoledgements slides.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  The workshop we attended in the morning was a great source of inspiration for me. Throughout the presentation Dr. Crawford repeated that we could use AI/ML to make anything easy for us, even scents circulation in the room to improve mood and concentration. I do beleive this is a field I would love to step foot in, its a great way to explore the various uses of AI/ML
