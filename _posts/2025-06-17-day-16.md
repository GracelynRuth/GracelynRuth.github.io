what_i_learned: |
  Today we spent a lot of time as a team. We had very little sessions with our mentors today. Each of us used various ML algorithms to train our models on sample data from Howard County. After we had all used various ML algorithms, we discussed our results together and helped each other fix issues we had in our code. Personally, I tested the Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression and SVR algorithms. From the tests that we ran, my results showed that Random forest and Gradient Boosting had the best results. Following that, we had a short review of our code and walked through it with each other. After that we had a little time of bonding and getting to know each other better, and was a time of team bonding.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
   Today I was able to familiarize myself with multiple ML models and understand how the functions in those libraries worked. I was able to also use the collab platform and get comfortable with coding in blocks and segments. I also enjoyed just having time with my group to get to teach each other and learn from each other.
