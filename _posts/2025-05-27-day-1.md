what_i_learned: |
  Today we had numerous opportunities to meet with our peers and get to know them. We played virtual games to familiarize ourselves with each other. We also had a detailed session about Git and GitHub. During this session we went through an example using google docs to understand the importance of collaboration. At the very end of our day, we created a website where we would log our daily activities in the form of blogs.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  I had a great time meeting my peers and getting to know their backgrounds in the scope of our project. I also enjoyed creating our very own websites from a template provided to us.
