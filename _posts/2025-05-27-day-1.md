what_i_learned: |
  Today we had numerous opportunities to meet with our peers and get to know them. Following our short session with our group, we took a python placement test, to test our knowledge on basic python. We played virtual speed networking bingo to familiarize ourselves with each other. We also had a detailed session about Git and GitHub. During this session we went through an example using google docs to understand the importance of collaboration. At the very end of our day, we created a website where we would log our daily activities in the form of blogs. We also played a game of jeopardy at the end of the Git and GitHub session. The game really helped me better understand the concepts we learnt about and served as a summary of everything that we learned in the session.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  I had a great time meeting my peers and getting to know their backgrounds in the scope of our project. I also enjoyed creating our very own websites from a template provided to us. Eventhough, I was not able to participate as much in the jeopary we played at the end of the GitHub session, I am looking forward to being a part of futher discussions and acivities like these.
