what_i_learned: |
  The first half of my day began with a short recap of what had happened over the last few days last week. I was able to get an insight on how far along our team had come from my peers. I learned that they were able to train and test the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting on 30 minute satellite data with data interpolation, but got relatively bad results. Our team has now decided to try out LSTMs and figure out the R2 for such an RNN. This was where I began today, I obtained code for a generic LSTM model and shared it with my peer to ensure it made sense. 

  Following that session, we had a brief segment with our graduate mentor to review a sample research paper to begin our paper later this week. We were told to write up a short paragraph about ourselves. We then played a team building activity of UNO and Trash (UNO cards memory game). Through this game I was able to test my memory skils and also bring up my energy.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  Today was a calm day, where I was able to get an overview of what we need to do in the upcoming weeks. I was able to understand that getting low r2 value is normal from the research paper we reviewed. So looking ahead, I am on trying out an LSTM model with the limited data that we have.
