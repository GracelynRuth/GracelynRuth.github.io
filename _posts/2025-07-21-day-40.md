what_i_learned: |
  The day began with an overleaf workshop on how to begin writing our paper. I learned the various ways to cite papers and authors on the first page of the paper. Another ascpect I learned was how to add sections of the paper into the main document as text files. Following this session, we split up our roles for writing out the research paper - I am responsible for the introduction and conclusion. The second half of our day consisted of us working on our code and trying our best to improve our r2 scores. The highest r2 score I got after altering the parameters was 0.82, which was much better than what I had previously.

reflection: |
  I learned a lot from the latter half of our day. Through much trial and error, I came to a conclusion that Gradient boost worked the best with our data, and that Neural Networks, in general, tend to perform better with consistent data.
