what_i_learned: |
  Today was a calm cloudy day filled with a lot of presentations to prepare for. For the first half of our day today I was able to add additional slides to our Mid-Summer Presentation. These slides primarily focused on the retrival and characteristics of our data. Following that segment, we individually worked on each of our slides for the week, wherein I was able to reflect on all I had accomplished over the week. Our mentor also asked us to identify the issues we had with our data, to solve the missing data points issue. We latter figured out through some python code that data was missing before we processed it.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  This week in general was great! I had a lot of fun spending time with peers and also reflecting on all that I had accomplished and come through throughout this week. I was also able to clearly describe the faults I had found with our data to our mentor, which I believe means that I have learned our data to some extent. That brought me joy, and I look forward to fixing all the issues we have with our data.
