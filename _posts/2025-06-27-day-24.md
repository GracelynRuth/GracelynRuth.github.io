what_i_learned: |
  Today was a calm cloudy day filled with a lot of presentations to prepare for. For the first half of our day today I was able to add additional slides to our Mid-Summer Presentation. These slides primarily focused on the retrival and characteristics of our data. Following that segment, we individually worked on each of our slides for the week, wherein I was able to reflect on all I had accomplished over the week.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  I was abe to improve my research and knowledge on neural networks. Even though the math was complex, I was able to grasp the general idea and benefits of neural networks. Despite the topic being useful in the field of image recognition, I obtained a general idea of what Machine Learning can truly do.
