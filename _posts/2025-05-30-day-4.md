what_i_learned: |
  During the first half of our day, we practiced our coding skills by carrying out various labs and practice problems our instructor gave us. Following that we also shared our code solutions with our peers. This part of the session was the most helpful for me personally, I got the opportunity to help debug our peers code solutions to direct them in right path. The latter portion of our day today, we had a detailed discussion on Generative AI. During our discussion we also played a couple games of Kahoot, which was a great way to test my knowledge on what we had learned in class. We were also able to explore various AI platforms such as Eleven AI, Sono AI and Character AI. I tried out Character AI, and from what I noticed, AI can be very realist and can converse with you as a real human. Lastly, we had a short project group activity where we voted on whether or not pictures were AI generated or real. It turns out, I really need to look out for fake things out there.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  Today I actuall ygot a gist of what AI truly is and what its built on. I believe this knowledge will help me comprehend the various things we will be learning and implementing in our research project. Additionally, with some activities we did during our AI session, I have come to an understanding that things may look deceivingly real, but many not be true.
