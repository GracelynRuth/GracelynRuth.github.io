what_i_learned: |
  Just as we had planned yesterday, we began our day by putting together ideas that we had brainstormed the day before. The next step was for us to decide on locations and film techniques to use when filming each snippet of our final video. We picked various natural locations around campus and filmed our clips. We did have to take multiple shots and angles to decide on which one would work well with our video. During the latter half of our day, we worked on editing our video and finding the various internet sourced videos of hair, satellites etc, that we had planned to incorporate. I was also able to find some background music for our video that we could use.

  Filming videos came with a lot of challenges in terms of correct angle, lighting and smooth transitions. Ensuring that everthing was right took a lot of time to plan and film.

reflection: |
  I am glad we got a good portion of our video done today. We just need to voice it over, add in the transitions and subtitles and we should have our pitch ready. Throughout today I was also able to reflect on key achievements we had made as a team and recall those moments, escpecially when we drew out a flowchart of each stage of our project for the pitch.
