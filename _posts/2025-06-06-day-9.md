what_i_learned: |
  We spent the first half of our day learning about the maintenance and cleaning of the LiDAR equipment that is on campus. From our mentors and the manual, I understood that good maintenance in vital for it to function correctly. I also had the opportunity to open up the equipment and view the various parts of the equipment that help it function. For the rest of our day we reflected on all that had happened this week and formed it into a presentation for us to record and upload.

  The weather outside was slightly hot and there were quite a few bugs outside when we attempted to clean the LiDAR Equipment.

reflection: |
  Today was a very calm day, I did a lot of self studying and trying to understand the concepts in python that we will be needing for the project. Reflecting on how this past week has been was also a great way for me to recall all the knowledge I had gained from my mentors and peers. While we were at the LiDAR station on campus we also got a chance to learn about the basic instruments that measure air qualities like wind speed and direction. After a week of learning about aerosols and the equiment that is used in measuring them, I am excited to learn of how Machine Learning can be implemented in this field next week!
