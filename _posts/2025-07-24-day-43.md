what_i_learned: |
  We spent our entire day today finishing up our video for the elevator pitch. All of us went on the internet to find background music that would fit into our video. Later on, we recorded the voice over in a quiet room and also added in subtitles to our video. Personally, I had a hard time modulating my voice to match the content of our video, i.e. tense for introduction and joyful for project description.

  Modulating my voice was by far the hardest thing I had to practice and perfect in a short amount of time.

reflection: |
  I am happy with how our video turned out today. I am also glad I was able to go out of my comfort zone to voice over the video. There were instances where I felt a little less confident, but my team was able to cheer me up. I am also very grateful for my team for contributing as much as they could to the video.
