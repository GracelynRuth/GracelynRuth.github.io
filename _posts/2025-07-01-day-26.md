what_i_learned: |
  With some review of our code with our mentor, I came to an understanding that my code had some major flaws. Firstly I was not supposed to drop as many columns to get a higher r2 coefficient. So I fixed my error, but still got a very low r2 score of 0.47. However, my peer who worked on the same station got a higher r2 score, which was what we decided to use for our presenation. Following our coding edits we had a short time of team bonding activities, where we played a couple rounds of UNO, it was a great time to bring our energy up after lunch and get started on the presentation slides.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  My day was great today, even though it involved a lot of coding and correcting my code. I was able to fix my errors however I still had issues with my output. I will begin working on how to fix the mistakes I made and try to bring up my r2 score.
