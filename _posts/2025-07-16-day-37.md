what_i_learned: |
  I spent my entire day trying out two different models on the new 30 minute data we obtained from our mentor today. This new data had a couple more points - 13000, which gave us much better results when training our models on the data we had. On my first try with Random Forest, the model yeilded an R2 coefficient of 0.6 and Gradient Boosting had an R2 of 0.75. These results seamed very pleasing and almost accurate. I was also able to visualize the data we got and discovered that our model is good at predicting lower concentrations of PM2.5 but does a bad job when it comes to greater values of pollution.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  From the data processing I did today, I was able to come to a conclusion that our data was much more helpful.
