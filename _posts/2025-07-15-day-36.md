what_i_learned: |
  Today we had an interesting day with the entire program participants. During the cohort connect we were tasked to play a game of bingo, where we had to meet new people in the program and learn something about them. I was able to discover that one person in our group is just like me, they read to themselves when learning. Following this activity, we all had to take two surveys, VARK (Visual, Aural, Read/Write and Kinesthetic) and Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. After taking the first survey, I discovered that I am a multimodal learner, with Aural being my most preferred method of learning. From the Type Test I found out that I am an ENFP (Extraversion, Intuition, Feeling and Perception) and a champion, communicator, charismatic and psychologist. 

  We also had to prepare a presentation detailing the strengths and challenges in our group based on our character types. I found our diversity to be a benefit but also a disadvantage, the fact that we had one type of each learner meant that we may have to learn independantly. 

  Finally we had a session with Dr. Li, where we had an overview of what we have to do for the upcoming days. I was tasked with figuring out why there is a high peak in PM2.5 in 2021, and also using interpolation to see if we get better results after training our model.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  I enjoyed learning more about myself and what kind of learner I am. Finding out that I'm an introvert shocked me the most, because I always knew myself as an introvert. Furthermore, the session we had with Dr. Li gave me a general idea of what we need to do in the upcoming days.
