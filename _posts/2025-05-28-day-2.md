what_i_learned: |
  We had a lot scheduled for today. We began by meeting out mentors and professors that we will be working with. During our smaller discussions with our project team, I got to interact with our professor and graduate assistant. Our professor mentioned that throughout this program we all will be learning together and nothing will be difficult to do, given the fact that we have help form our peers and mentors. 
  Following that session, we were placed into groups based on our python knowledge. I was placed in the intermediate level and I felt like today's course was like a refresher and I was able to recall everything that I had previously studied. We used a new platform - replit, to code in python. 
  Finally, we ended our day with a fun game of virtual headbandz, a game in which one person guesses whatever is on a card picked by Michael(it could be a food, animal, thing, etc) by asking yes/no questions. We had one person enter the waiting room, whilst the rest of the group reads what the word is from the card. After the person re-entered, we set a 60s timer and had the person ask quetions that would potentially guide them to an answer. 

blockers: |
  The only blocker I could think of was using replit. I had never used it before, however, with our instructor's clear instructions on what to do, I think it went pretty well.

reflection: |
  Meeting with my professor and mentor today was a great opportunity for me to understand what we were going to do in the project. I felt more comfortable after our professor told us that since we all are on different levels of programming and atmospherical science knowledge, we will work together to build our model and help each other out. The python course really helped me refresh my mind on some python basics and also advanced skills.
