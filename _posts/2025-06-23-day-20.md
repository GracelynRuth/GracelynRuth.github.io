  A huge portion of our day today was dedicated to experimenting and analysing data from two ground stations, Padonia and Howard specifically. We began our day with a brief overview of the metrics library in python. I learned through that session that there are many ways to analyse whether or not the model you are testing is efficient and accurate. Some methods that we learned today were mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), r2 etc. The closer the value of r2 to 1 the more accurate the model and the lower the errors the better the model. Another ascpect of ML that we learned today was the importance of features on the

   I was able to understand the mechanism of neural networks from the short YouTube videos I watched. Learning about the background of ML models was very interesting to me, as it was an example of how computer systems are inpired by human characteristics and processes. By learning about how these models work, I was able to get an idea of why Neural Networks is probably one of the most efficient models, as it uses layers to approximate its final prediction.
