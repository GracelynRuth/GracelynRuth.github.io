  We spent a lot of time today talking about team building and bonding activities. We began with a game of Taboo, where each individual would have to describe a word to a group of 20 students within a time limit of 60 seconds. Through this game I was able to improve my quick thinking skills and also my communication skills. We also played a game of Jenga, where each team had volunteers to try to pick a block out of the jenga tower without toppling it over. Our team won the first game and lost the second, but I think it was a great way to meet students in other teams and to improve our communication skills. 

  The second thing we had on our schedule was to learn about Overleaf. We had a brief overview of how to write reports on overleaf for our final group report. 

  Within our team, we were also able to out for lunch and get to know each others cultures. Through this event I was able to get to know our faculty and graduate mentors better, and also learn a lot about the Chinese and Nigerian culture. Futhermore, I was able to share my own cultural experiences and practices with my team. The best part of lunch time today was that I learned how to use chopsticks!

  After all the team bonding that we had done throughout the day, we had a short session about the difference between Machine Learning models and algorithms. I understood that an ML model is a trained ML algorithm.
