what_i_learned: |
  Today was a day that had a combination of research about papers that have implemented AI into the domain of monitoring and predicting PM2.5 at stations various countries. I was able to find papers that have done the same project that we were assigned. I  was able to investigate how they had used python to carry out our project. Following that session, I was able to learn how to plot and use the various libraries in python, such as mathplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
   I was able to master my python skills in the two sessions we had today. With the little knowledge of python I think I have a general idea of writing a report and the various charts and plots that need to prove the thesis of our paper. Through the literature reviews I was also able to see how other researches were able to come to conclusions on how to use AI in the field of Climate Science.
