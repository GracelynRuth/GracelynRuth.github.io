what_i_learned: |
  Today was a day that had a combination of research about papers that have implemented AI into the domain of monitoring and predicting PM2.5 at stations various countries. I was able to find papers that have done the same project that we were assigned. I  was able to investigate how they had used python to carry out our project. Following that session, I was able to learn how to plot and use the various libraries in python, such as mathplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  I was able to build my knowledge in the field of climate science and also see the real world application of computer engineering in the field of climate science. Researching papers and reviewing them was also a great opportunity for my to build my research and paper writing skills. I look forward to learning more about climate science in forthcoming sessions.
