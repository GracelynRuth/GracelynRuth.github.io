what_i_learned: |
  The first half of today was a campus tour of Morgan State University. Our program coordinator walked us through all the buildings on campus and showed us the main CEAMLS Lab. The tour was very informative and I got to see all the dining halls and facilities at Morgan State. Upon the completion of our tour, we had a short group session about our weekly deliverables, through this session I learned that we need our video to be short, concise and informative.
  For the second of our day we went to the top floor of the Martin D Jenkins Building, and launched a helium air balloon that was connected to a styrofoam cup that had a chip with all the different sensors to measure the temperature, humidity and pressure at different altitudes. During this session, I was intrigued by the fact that there are only a few of these ground Lidar stations at which balloons are launched to measure data every thursay at 2pm.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  I learned a lot through hands on experience today. Firstly walking through the campus was a great way to meet new people who were in other project teams. Launching the balloon and looking at live data from the sensors on the balloon was a great way to understand how data is retrieved from ground stations all over the US.
