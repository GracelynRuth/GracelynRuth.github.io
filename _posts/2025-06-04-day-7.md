what_i_learned: |
  We began our day with a short discussion of what we had learned yesterday. Our mentor also walked us through obtaining data from NASA's Giovanni. We were also tasked to help our peers get comfortable with python, so I helped the students who were in Python 101 understand basic functions of lists in python. We then met our faculty mentor today, and had a detailed discussion with her learning of the outline of our project and what tasks we would need to complete. For the last segment of our day, we had a short Q and A session with Dr. Li, where she tested our understanding of Aerosols and urged us to comprehend all the different aspects of it by tomorrow, so we will be all set for the upcoming days.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  Meeting our faculty mentor was a great opportunity for me to learn more about the climate science aspect of our project, rather than just trying to implement AI into the field of climate science. I do also beleive, that the short Q and A session we had with Dr. Li encouraged me to learn more about the topic and understand our project better.
