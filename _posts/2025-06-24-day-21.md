what_i_learned: |
  We began our day with a short review of our Presentation for Friday. Following that we spent the entire day modifying our code for our respective datasets. I worked on Padonia data and was able to obtain multiple graphs that represented the data in a very consise manner. My aim was to obtain graphs that depicted the correlation between AOD, PM2.5 and Time (Time of Day and Month of Year). I used multiple python libraries such as datetime, matplotlib.pyplot and pandas to implement this. Upon plotting graphs from our data I discovered that we were missing a lot of data - we specifically had no data points for the months after August. This lead to a slight issue in our predictions, therefore I considered this a hinderance to getting accurate values. In the latter half of our day, we worked on our individual slides for the Presentation on Friday. Keeping in mind that presentation slides must be short and concise, I was able to condense all my accomplishments, challenges and solutions into two slides. While creating my slides, I ensured that the pictures I added were relevant to what I had mentioned as bullet points on the slide.  
  
blockers: |
  The greatest blocker I had today was my inability to concentrate as time went by. We spent a huge portion of our day in front of computers at our tables and I really needed a break.

reflection: |
   I was able to explore the various data manipulation and filtering techniques python offers to obtain the meaningful graphs. Along the way I used AI bots and help from my peers to complete the implementation process. Generating multiple graphs also gave me the liberty to narrow down the correlations between PM2.5 and the parameters to specific features that impact our prediction. Visualizing our data was extremely helpful in figuring out whether or not the data we had was consistent.
