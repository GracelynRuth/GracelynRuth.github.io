what_i_learned: |
  Today was our first in person day in the CEAMLS Program, hence we began with some introductions and then moved on to understanding what AI research truly is. For the short session we had with the director of the program, I was able to understand that the issue we have with AI is that it produces non-deterministic results, which limits our ability to generalize or directly find correlations. Furthermore, she emphasized on the fact that in order to model things with AI, we need a well defined Research Question. I also learned that in order to ensure predictable results from an AI model, I need to train it with large sets of data, such that when I test it on unseen data, it is able to form a new relation and produce desirable results. 
  Following that we participated in the marshmallow challenge, a team building and collaboration activity. In this activity, I learned how communicaiton and accepting your peers opinions really mattered. We had to construct the tallest structure in the room using spagetti and tape that could hold up a marshmallow. We ensured that we considered and thoughtully executed each of our ideas.
  For the last segment of our day, we met with our graduate mentor and discussed the main terminologies in our project, such as Aerosol concentrations, PM 2.5 etc. We also had a brief overview of what our project was going to look like. From this session I learned that our aim in this project is to come up with an AI model that can predict Air Pollution levels based on satellite data in urban areas.

  For me personally, trying to visually understand where our lab was located was a little bit hard. It is about a 10 minute walk from the Business building, but I still have a hard time figuring out how to get there by walk.

reflection: |
  I learned a lot today, the most important thing that I was able to understand today was our project plan and outline. I also was able to meet my peers in person during our ice breaker activity, and that made it easier for us to discuss our ideas on the project and to share information about each other. With the knowledge I gained today about our project, I look forward to learning more about our topic on Air Pollution and how AI can help predict it.
