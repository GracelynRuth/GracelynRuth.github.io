what_i_learned: |
  I spent most of my day working on the report and presentation slides. First I read through my introduction and added in some extra ascpects of our project to make it a better explanation of our project. Following that, I uniformly formated some graphs from the Padonia Station with a peer, to put on the paper in the results and analysis section. In order to accomplish this I had to add new lines of code to make all the feature imporatance graphs look neat and legible. I was also able to begin writing the conclusion today with the challenges we faced and the explanation for our results. The last thing I was able to start was our presentation slides, I was assigned the challenges and future work slides. During this time I was able to think back and recall all the coding we had done in the past and analyze the challenges and solutions we had implemented.

  Figuring out how to change my code to match my collegues outputs was hard.

reflection: |
  I am glad I was able to almost complete my parts of the paper today. With the presentation slides coming together too, I am eager for the final presentation. Reflecting on how this program has gone so far has been something I have been doing for both the paper and the presenation. Through these sessions, I am glad that we have come a long way and have learned much from the mistakes we made.
