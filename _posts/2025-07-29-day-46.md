what_i_learned: |
  We spent the entire day today finalizing our slides and presentation. I was able to complete the challenges and future works section on both documents. However, on the overleaf pdf we ran into an error that was hard for us to resolve. The images from the previous section overlapped with the conclusion. In order to resolve this issue, I had to do a little bit of reseach to try to understand the various lines of code in overleaf. In the process of doing this I learned how to create a new page in overleaf and constrict images to specific locations on a page. Finally to conclude our day, Fikewa gave me a brief summary of the introduction and my part in it.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  I was able to make a lot of progress today. I got a majority of my parts on the paper and slides done and was also able to learn a lot more about overleaf. I was also able to get a general idea of how the presentation would flow.
