what_i_learned: |
  Today was full of practicing and editing our presentation content and slides. We went through our presentation about 6 times, modifying it every time. Initially we implemented all the changes our mentor had for us from the previous day. The first time we ran through our presentation we went a little bit overtime and I was a bit less confident with what I had to say. However, with practice I was able to paraphrase everything I had to say. As we practiced I was able to build up my confidence and become better at presenting. One skill I had to practice today was to describe and elaborate on images. This was initially challenging until I thought about all the preprocessing that went into creating and displaying those images. 

  For our team building activity today, we played a couple rounds of hangman. We had a great time! Through this game I was able to see that different perspectives my peers had on the same concept. It was intriguing to see how different perspectives can be derived from a simple game of hangman!

  No blockers today!

  I was able to practice my presenting and summarizing skills today. Through each mock presentation, I was able to manage my time properly and adjust my pace and content accordingly. With the practice we had today, I believe we will do great at the presentations tomorrow!
