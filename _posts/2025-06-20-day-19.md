  Today was a long day in which we carried out many activities. We had to clean up our room fridge and oven. Following that we prepared our slides for todays presentation and were able to also research about the various ML models. I researched about Neural Networks. I was able to understand the fundamental concepts of layers, weights and scaling values.
