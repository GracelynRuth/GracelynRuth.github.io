  Today was a long day in which we carried out many activities. We had to clean up our room fridge and oven. Following that we prepared our slides for today's presentation. While we were making the slides I was able to reflect on all that I had accomplished this week. I am glad that we have attained a stage of comprehending how to implement various ML models on real life data. We each also picked one ML model to research on and share with each other. I researched about Neural Networks. I was able to understand the fundamental concepts of layers, weights and scaling values. I discovered today that many systems we use incorporate this. An easily identifiable example is facial recognition software, used to unlock our phones, the first layer of the model's hidden layer separates the face from the background and each consecutive layer identifies patterns on the face. 

  Following this we had a short walk to the civil engineering building, where our friend had to take a car simulation test. This walk, though short, served as a means of refreshment and brought back all my energy after a long day of sitting down. Finally to wrap up our day, we recorded our weekly deliverable and submitted it.

   I was able to understand the mechanism of neural networks from the short YouTube videos I watched. Learning about the background of ML models was very interesting to me, as it was an example of how computer systems are inpired by human characteristics and processes. By learning about how these models work, I was able to get an idea of why Neural Networks is probably one of the most efficient models, as it uses layers to approximate its final prediction.
