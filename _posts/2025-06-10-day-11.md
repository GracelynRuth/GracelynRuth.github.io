what_i_learned: |
  Today I did a lot of coding in python. I learned some basic methods that are a part of python's Pandas library, such as head(), tail(), clip(), merge() etc. I was able to use these functions on real climate data from two different stations in the US. With our elementary knowledge that we had with the library, we were given the task of cleaning and merging data from the Padonia station. In the process of analysing data from this station I learned how to plot graphs in python from a data frame.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  I learned a lot of data processing and analysing techniques today. I was able to understand what our project will require in terms of coding and data processing. Understanding this aspect of our project made it easier for me to visualize what we would need to do with the data we will be using in our project. Learning how to clean large amounts of data was also a vital skill that would be needed for our project.
