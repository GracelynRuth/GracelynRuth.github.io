what_i_learned: |
  I spent most of my day today researching about Aerosols, their lifecycles and sources and sinks. We were instructed to use AI platforms to learn about the content, and then share it with our mentor to see how efficient AI can be in explaining complex topics. After our research, I read a couple literature reviews to build my knowledge on the sources and sinks of Aerosols. I had the oppotunity to go up to the LiDAR station on campus to replace a MoDem that was faulty. Through this activity, I was able to see all the wiring and equipment that form the LiDAR station. This was a great experience as I was able to see how my field of study is applied into the real world in multiple field.

  No blockers today!

reflection: |
  I was able to build my knowledge in the field of climate science and also see the real world application of computer engineering in the field of climate science. Researching papers and reviewing them was also a great opportunity for my to build my research and paper writing skills. I look forward to learning more about climate science in forthcoming sessions.
